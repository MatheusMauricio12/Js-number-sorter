This is just a simple project that i've coded the JS's part just in order to train myself. I will probably not update it furthermore. I know it's some logical and visual problems, but i cannot waste too much time on this simple project.

If one day i want to fix some of it problems: 
- This code(line 18), changed the css of the tag with id: #result:  tagContent.innerHTML = `Sorted numbers: ${sortedNumbers}`;      
- There are no preventions for 0 or negative inputs. So the user can easily break the program.
- There is no guide to users, it's just a really simple interface and code.

Thanks Alura for providing me the HTML and CSS that was mostly done already!

Thank you for passing by! And best regards! 

Att, Matheus Mauricio.
